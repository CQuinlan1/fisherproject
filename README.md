Python investigation of the Iris data set
This data set I hope to investigate over the next few weeks and break my work on it into steps.
Discuss the background of the data set itself:
    1.  Then using Python, download the csv file
    2.  Present the data in table form.
    3.  Show the min/max/ and mean of each column as required.
    4.  Look at the min/max/mean of each type of iris.
    5.  Graphically represent the dataset.
    6.  Highlight irregularites or similarites.
    7.  Look at standard deviation, correlation and any predictability or inference we might find.
    8.  Summarise findings.
